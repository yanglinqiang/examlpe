## chronicle-map

* [Chronicle Map 2 has hard creation-time limit on the number of entries storable in a Chronicle Map. If the size exceeds this limit, an exception is thrown. In Chronicle Map 3, this limitation is removed, though the number of entries still has to be configured on the Chronicle Map creation, exceeding this configured limit is possible, but discouraged. See the Number of entries configuration section.](https://github.com/OpenHFT/Chronicle-Map#difference-between-chronicle-map-2-and-3)
